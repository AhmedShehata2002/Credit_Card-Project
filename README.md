# Personal Projects 
1. ## Credit Card Default:
### Objective:
In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model using machine learning classification techniques to assess whether individuals seeking loans pose a risk of defaulting or not. Leveraging a dataset containing a variety of independent variables such as checking account balance, credit history, purpose, and loan amount, our objective is to create a robust model that accurately categorizes loan applicants as either defaulters or non-defaulters.

### Skills/Libraries Used :
This project is supervised, as we are using labeled data (defaulters vs. non-defaulters) to train the predictive model. The model will learn from historical data to make predictions on new loan applicants.Skills and libraries include decision tree modeling, ensemble methods (bagging and boosting), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature importance assessment using GINI impurity. Python libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization are utilized.

2. ## Analyzing Subscription Churn Rates Leveraging Advanced SQL Techniques for Actionable Insights:
### Objective:
Analyzing subscription churn rates for Codeflix, a streaming service, using advanced SQL techniques to provide insights into user retention. The goal is to identify patterns in user cancellation behavior over time and differences between user groups to assist Codeflix in improving subscriber retention strategies.

### Skills/Libraries Used:
SQL techniques such as aggregates, unions, temporary tables, cross joins, and case statements are employed to extract meaningful insights from the data. Advanced SQL techniques for data manipulation and analysis, including aggregates, unions, temporary tables, cross joins, case statements, and aliasing.

3.  ## Oura Health Ring//Ollama Panda's AI Integration for Data Analysis:
### Objective:
This is my next upcoming project in this project. Integrating Panda's AI with Groq and Ollama to create an intuitive interface for interactive database queries and rapid analytics. The project focuses on enabling efficient data integration and analysis using AI-driven tools, enhancing the usability and insights derived from database interactions.
