2. Analyzing Subscription Churn Rates Leveraging Advanced SQL Techniques for Actionable Insights: In this project, we're diving into subscription churn rates for Codeflix, a new streaming service. Our main goal is to figure out how many users are canceling their subscriptions over time. We're also looking at two different groups of users to see if there are differences in how often they cancel. We'll dig through the subscription data, following Codeflix's rules like the minimum subscription length of 31 days. We'll use some advanced SQL techniques like aggregates, unions, temporary tables, cross joins, case statements, and aliasing to do this. Our aim is to provide insights that help Codeflix keep users around and grow their business.
3. Oura Health Ring: This is my next upcoming project in this project I will download over 5 months of my personal activity and sleep metrics to assess my performance based on my “readiness level”, activity level and sleep. Other metrics will include body temperature, REM sleep, HRV, Steps, Equivalent Walking Distance and recovery index. This data will be used to assess how I could further improve my health and wellbeing as well as provide as overview of my physical performance over the last couple of months.
